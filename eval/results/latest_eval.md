## Notes

- Router accuracy checks `question_type`, `routed_mode`, and final `retrieval_mode`.
- Source recall@5 checks whether required source filenames appear in answer sources, graph evidence, or hierarchical supporting chunks.
- Citation coverage measures whether each answer returned at least one source-like evidence reference.
- Graph route useful cases require graph context or graph paths plus expected concepts.
- No-context fallback checks that relation questions with no matching course graph concepts fall back with a warning.
